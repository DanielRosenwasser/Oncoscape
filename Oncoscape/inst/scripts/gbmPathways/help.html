<h3 class="modal-title"> The GBM Pathways Network Help</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
<p>This tab presents an interactive Cytoscape network display of pathways in Glioblastoma
multiformed, curated by Hamid Bolouri.</p>
<h3>Pathway Curation</h3>
<p> From 96 publications. </p>
<h3>Nodes and Edges</h3>
    Please refer to legend page. 
<h3>Data Selection and Sending Out</h3>
The network view can be zoomed and dragged to focus on different section.
You can do the selection by clicking on the nodes of interest while holding "command" key on Mac. The selected nodes will be highlighted in yellow. By clicking "Zoom Selected", the view will focus on the selected nodes only.
They can also be sent to other applications within Oncoscape.

For example, when "PI3K class1a", "PIK3CD" and "PIP3" are selected, you can click on the dropdown menu "send Selection..." to "MarkersAndPatients".
On "MarkersAndPatients" view, the overlapped gene will be highlighed by an orange circle in the Gene Markers Panel in the central of the tab. This allows you to continue your thoughts on how this gene marker plays roles in specific subtype.
<h3>Data Receiving</h3>
When you send sample subsets from other application to GBM Pathways tab, the program will display each sample's profile by highlightening the altered genes/conditions/factors. 
You can also specify the interval pause between the displays of two samples to control the movie speed. When the Movie starts, you can stop it at any time by clicking on stop.
